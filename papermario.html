                    <h3>REASONING FOR INCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>Paper Mario is one of the most criminally overlooked characters in the history of Smash Bros. Debuting in the classic Super Paper Mario over two decades ago and following that up with the masterpiece that is The Thousand Year Door, the quality of his games attracted a loving fanbase. While the games have been losing fan appeal as of late, he is such a creative spin on Mario that making him a member of the roster would be a great move for the franchise.</p>
                    <h3>MOVESET POTENTIAL</h3>
                    <p>Unlike Doctor Mario, Paper Mario has plenty of moves that could potentially be used to prevent him from being another clone of Mario. His paper body and paper-related abilities could make for very interesting moves aesthetically and mechanically, like having his Up-B being a paper airplane, or turning into a roll of paper for his Side-B.</p>
