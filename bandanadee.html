                    <h3>REASONING FOR INCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>Bandana Dee has long been the go-to answer for the next Kirby representative to be included in a Smash game. With his adorable looks and unique weapon in a spear, it's rather surprising that Sakurai has not included him already considering that he has helmed several Kirby games in the past. His charm and overall fan appeal make him a sharp choice for inclusion in Nintendo's hall of fame.</p>
                    <h3>MOVESET POTENTIAL</h3>
                    <p>Bandana Dee actually already appears in a Smash-inspired game in Super Smash Flash 2, which gave him an excellent moveset to base things off of. He should prioritize attacking with his spear, perhaps throwing it for a projectile and spinning it as a helicopter for recovery purposes.</p>
