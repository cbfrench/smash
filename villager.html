                    <p>An energetic young man from a peaceful town in Animal Crossing, he is eager to make his Smash Bros. debut! His Balloon Trip recovery lets him fly like a character from Balloon Fight. The Villager sets out to answer that age-old question: If a tree falls on the battlefield and foes are beneath it, do they get launched?</p>
                    <p>Just a normal guy living a normal life in a normal town â€” his special moves, however, are anything but. He can pocket items, projectiles, and even beams, and then pull them out at a moment's notice. His down special lets her plant a tree, water it, and chop it down. If he leaves the tree standing, he can use the axe against foes.</p>
