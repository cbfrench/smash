                    <p>The protagonist of Final Fantasy VII, Cloud wields the enormous Buster Sword, a memento from his comrade Zack. Once a soldier of Shinra, he now fights as a mercenary against the corporation he originally served. His decision to join Avalanche's insurgence, however, will transform his destiny.</p>
                    <p>Filling the Limit Gauge allows Cloud to perform a Limit Break, supercharging his next special move. His down special becomes Finishing Touch. With a huge swing of his sword, Cloud summons a whirlwind that inflicts only 1% damage, but boasts brutal launch power. Go for a KO while foes' damage is still low!</p>
