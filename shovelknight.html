                    <h3>REASONING FOR INCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>Shovel Knight is one of the most popular choices for a new character in Smash, and it's easy to see why: universally loved game, amazing design, and he supported the Nintendo during the Wii U era. This bright blue bruiser wields his trusty shovel against a variety of different enemies, it only stands to reason that that shovel would be used to take down his enemies in Smash as well.</p>
                    <h3>MOVESET POTENTIAL</h3>
                    <p>Shovel Knight has plenty of moves that he could take from his games. He could shoot fireballs with his B-move, ride on his cart with his side-B, use his anchor to recover, and could even use his fishing rod as one of his taunts.</p>
