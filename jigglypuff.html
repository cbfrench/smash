                    <p>This Normal/Fairy-type Pokémon is best known for its soothing singing, which can put foes to sleep. In Smash Bros., it fights best in the air and can even jump six times in a row. The downside, though, is that Jigglypuff's so light, most opponents could launch it in their sleep!</p>
                    <p>Jigglypuff's down special Rest sends this Pokémon into a deep sleep that damages and launches any foe it's touching upon napping. They'll even take damage after being hit! It's a pretty challenging move to land, though, and it leaves Jigglypuff wide open to revenge. Be careful when you use it.</p>
