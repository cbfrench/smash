                    <h3>REASONING FOR INCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>Sceptile has been a fan-favorite Pokemon ever since his introduction in Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire in 2003. With his sleek design and varied movepool, he inspired GameFreak to give him a Mega Evolution in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, which vastly improved upon his usability and popularity by giving him a purpose. Sceptile has had a long wait, but I believe that it is finally time to let Sceptile into Smash as the representative Grass-type starter Pokemon.</p>
                    <h3>MOVESET POTENTIAL</h3>
                    <p>Sceptile could attack with moves similar to Greninja, using Leaf Blade for his slashing strikes rather than blades of water. He could also utilize his tail and the spores on his back to keep the opponent at bay from a distance. Sceptile could perform as a slower variant of Greninja that zones more than rushes in, which would be a great addition to the game.</p>
