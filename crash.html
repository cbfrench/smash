                    <h3>REASONING FOR INCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>Crash Bandicoot has long been one of the characters jokingly put on many people's wish lists even though Sony and Activision had been fairly protective of the character and neglecting to release new games for any platform whatsoever. However, with the release of the original remastered trilogy on the PS4 and the announcement of the Switch version releasing in July, Crash has never been more likely to make an appearance in Smash Bros.</p>
                    <h3>MOVESET POTENTIAL</h3>
                    <p>Crash has many past games to create his moveset from. He could use his iconic spin move to keep enemies away from him and he could use any number of gadgets from his main games or even the mini-game bundles that he and his friends starred in.</p>
