                    <h3>REASONING FOR INCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>Bomberman is one of those characters that has had some pretty rough luck over the years. Their developer recently went under and fans are unsure who really owns the liscense to this once iconic character, making the future for Bomberman very uncertain. However, just as Smash 4 did for the resurgeance in Mega Man's popularity, I think Bomberman should be included to honor his contributions to gaming and to hopefully get him another game in the works.</p>
                    <h3>MOVESET POTENTIAL</h3>
                    <p>Bomberman could take a page from his games and primarily just drop bombs with his B-move. His other specials would be focused around moving that bomb around the stage, perhaps adding damage to when it explodes, so that moving it around could do big damage.</p>
